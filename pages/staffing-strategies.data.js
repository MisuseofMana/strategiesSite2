        `In response to the industry's high demand for qualified, temporary
        therapists and nurses, Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva opened Staffing
        Strategies in 2010. After managing their own supplemental staff at
        Rehab Strategies, they used that experience and applied it toward
        opening the next phase of The Strategies enterprise.`,

        `Our facilities and partners now benefit from Staffing Strategies’
        ability to alleviate significant gaps in their therapy coverage.`,

        `To help fill these gaps, Staffing Strategies developed a reliable,
        on-call roster of physical therapists, occupational therapists,
        speech therapists and specifically trained assistants. Our staff can
        be assigned to a facility for coverage lasting as short as a few
        hours to concurrent weeks lasting as long as the facility needs.`,

        `In 2018, after such an overwhelming response from facilities needing
        open shift replacements, Staffing Strategies added nurses to our
        stable of staffing professionals. We deliver day, evening and
        overnight shift coverage. Many of the nurses will provide double
        shift coverage when needed.`,

        `Scheduling personnel is a constant strain for all healthcare
        facilities. Let Staffing Strategies be the one to relieve your
        stress by utilizing their therapists and available nurses.`,

        `At times, all healthcare facilities find themselves short staffed.
        By utilizing consistent replacement coverage through Staffing
        Strategies, neither patients nor healthcare providers will
        experience a lapse in quality care. Staffing Strategies is here for
        you; let us be the one you call to fill your scheduling void.`,
