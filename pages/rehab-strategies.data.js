        `Is your facility struggling with census and losing patients to home health? Do your patients need a spark to get them on the road to recovery?`,
        `Rehab Strategies can help with these troubling statistics. We will provide your facility with a full-time physical, occupational and speech staff who will work on site daily. The staff will engage the residents by creating a cohesive therapy department that provides exemplary patient care. Patients become familiar with the therapists and love to be a part of the therapy family while they work to recover strength and health. Many residents enjoy the personal attention and comradery so much that they continue with their therapy services through private pay. One uniqueservice Rehab Strategies provides is a Wellness Program for seniors focusing on health and wellbeing. Residents can participate in Tai Chi, Pilates and yoga as well as a wide variety of aerobic classes, and our certified athletic trainers specialize in Parkinson’s classes like The Climb, Rock Steady Boxing, and Lee Silverman Voice Training and the Loud Program.
