        After working for similar rehabilitation companies, Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva launched Rehab Strategies in 2006. Because Ron and Jamey are therapists themselves with over 50 years of combined clinical experience in the rehabilitation industry, they will work hand-in-hand with your company on how best to construct the therapy department. If management or consulting is what your facility needs, Rehab Strategies can also provide expertise in those areas.
        `,

        `
        Rehab Strategies will alleviate stress by internalizing decisions and solving problems for any provider housing a rehab department. Ron and Jamey will work in conjunction with the facility to build therapy teams that are highly motivated, efficient and produce cost-effective outcomes. Their model isn’t just for long term care facilities; it can be tailored to fit the needs of hospitals, outpatient centers, skilled nursing facilities, assisted and independent living centers.

        In response to the industry high demand for qualified, temporary therapists and nurses, Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva opened Staffing Strategies in 2010. After managing their own supplemental staff at Rehab Strategies, they used that experience and applied it toward opening the next phase of The Strategies enterprise.

        `
        Our facilities and partners now benefit from Staffing Strategies’ ability to alleviate significant gaps in their therapy coverage.
        `,
        `
        To help fill these gaps, Staffing Strategies developed a reliable, on-call roster of physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and specifically trained assistants. Our staff can be assigned to a facility for coverage lasting as short as a few hours to concurrent weeks lasting as long as the facility needs.

        In 2018, the entrepreneurial pair of Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva achieved their longstanding dream of owning and operating a facility that provides long-term residential care to individuals with intellectual disabilities, traumatic brain injuries and physical disabilities. They had the opportunity to enter the marketplace with the advent of Care Strategies by purchasing a small facility in Muncie, Indiana: Brookside Care Strategies. With that purchase, Ron and Jamey were able to incorporate all their services, completing their vision by providing therapy, staffing and the latest technology in one location.
