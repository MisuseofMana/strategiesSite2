            question: `What equipment can ITS provide?`,
            answer: `

            question: `What is the MR Cube?`,
            answer: `
            It is a portable, functional training and testing device that therapists can use to not only eliminate monotony of a therapy session, but also collect objective data on a patient’s progress.

        {
            question: `Why should our facility purchase a MR Cube for our therapy gym?`,
            answer: `
            MR Cube takes the guesswork out of evaluating a patient. With the objective data collected straight to a computer, the patient’s baseline is collected and progress can be obtained with each use.
            `,
        },
        {
            question: `How does the MR Cube work?`,
            answer: `
            The therapist connects the MR Cube to the patient via a tether and has the patient perform “games” on a computer screen. While the patient is engaged in a fun therapy session, the portable dynamo reads the data collected from the patient and downloads it to a computer.
            `,
        },
        {
            question: `How is the MR Cube better than the old tried and true methods used in the average therapy session?`,
            answer: `
            The data collected from the MR Cube provides the therapist with objective results instantly while the patient enjoys his/her therapy session. With the exercises creatively disguised as a video game, the patient’s competitive nature is sparked and each therapy session becomes a challenge to increase his/her area of weakness by trying to beat the previous score.

        {
            question: `
            How can our therapy department see the MR Cube in action?
            `,
            answer: `
            Contact Jamey Kleva at <a href="mailto: jkleva@innovativetreatment.net">jkleva@innovativetreatment.net</a> and she will schedule a demonstration. Our therapists will set an onsite visit where your therapists and patients can learn about the MR Cube and receive hands on training.

        {
            question: `How will we know if more than one MR Cube is needed for our department?`,
            answer: `
            Once your patients experience their exercises on the MR Cube, they will be fighting over MR Cube time.

        {
            question: `Can the MR Cube be rented to our facility?`,
            answer: `
            Yes, contact <a href="mailto: jkleva@innovativetreatment.net">Jamey Kleva</a> for details on a rental agreement.

            question: `Is the software updated and are the updates included in the price?`,
            answer: `

        {
            question: `With staff turnover, how can we avoid a new staff leaving the MR Cube in the corner and not using it to its full potential?`,
            answer: `
            Our therapists can set up a retraining session to make sure the MR Cube is being used to its full potential.

        },
        {
            question: `Will the MR Cube pay for itself?`,
            answer: `
            Yes, by adding additional HCPCS treatment codes, Medicare will reimburse for the MR Cube treatments.
