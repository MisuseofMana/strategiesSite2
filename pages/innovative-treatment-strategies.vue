          <p class="text-body-1">
            Is your therapy gym stagnant? Are your therapists using the same
            antiquated techniques with patients? If so, ITS can help.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            With technology developing at a lightning pace, Ron Cram and Jamey
            Kleva quickly identified a need for advanced equipment to optimize
            the performance and testing of patients receiving therapy services.
            With that idea in mind, Innovative Treatment Strategies (ITS) was
            born in 2013. ITS brings the latest technology to our clients at a
            reasonable cost and with therapists that are knowledgeable in both
            the use and efficacy of the equipment. This includes their exclusive
            product, The MR Cube.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            The MR Cube is a cutting edge diagnostic tool that can eliminate
            monotony while at the same time collect objective data on a
            patient’s progress.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            The MR Cube can turn a tedious therapy session into a competitive
            experience where the patient is engaged in the visual game
            component. Packed with the latest technology, The MR Cube is a
            small, portable dynamo that can read the data collected from the
            patient and download it to a computer. The data provides the
            therapist with objective results instantly while the patient enjoys
            his/her therapy session. With the exercises creatively disguised as
            a video game, the patient’s competitive nature is sparked and each
            therapy session becomes a challenge to increase his/her area of
            weakness by trying to beat the previous score.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            Patients love it. Therapists love it. The MR Cube adds a whole new
            level to the therapy gym. Let ITS bring the MR Cube to your facility
            and show you what it can do. Contact ITS today at

          <p class="text-body-1">
            ITS' solutions help reduce patients' pain in therapy, and speed up
            healing by allowing the patient to engage with the systems they are
            using. This allows the therapists to introduce more intense
            therapies sooner to arrive at the desired treatment outcomes faster.
            By allowing your therapists to be trained on and use the latest and
            most effective products, you offer a more enriching therapy
            environment for improved job satisfaction and retention. Athletic
            Trainers are now able to accelerate recovery and improve outcomes
            for athletes and others with sports related injuries.
