            What is Staffing Strategies and what can we do for you?
          </h2>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            In response to the industry's high demand for qualified, temporary
            therapists and nurses, Ron Cram and Jamey Kleva opened Staffing
            Strategies in 2010. After managing their own supplemental staff at
            Rehab Strategies, they used that experience and applied it toward
            opening the next phase of The Strategies enterprise.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            Our facilities and partners now benefit from Staffing Strategies’
            ability to alleviate significant gaps in their therapy coverage.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            To help fill these gaps, Staffing Strategies developed a reliable,
            on-call roster of physical therapists, occupational therapists,
            speech therapists and specifically trained assistants. Our staff can
            be assigned to a facility for coverage lasting as short as a few
            hours to concurrent weeks lasting as long as the facility needs.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            In 2018, after such an overwhelming response from facilities needing
            open shift replacements, Staffing Strategies added nurses to our
            stable of staffing professionals. We deliver day, evening and
            overnight shift coverage. Many of the nurses will provide double
            shift coverage when needed.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            Scheduling personnel is a constant strain for all healthcare
            facilities. Let Staffing Strategies be the one to relieve your
            stress by utilizing their therapists and available nurses.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-1">
            At times, all healthcare facilities find themselves short staffed.
            By utilizing consistent replacement coverage through Staffing
            Strategies, neither patients nor healthcare providers will
            experience a lapse in quality care. Staffing Strategies is here for
            you; let us be the one you call to fill your scheduling void.

                  Regretfully, this does happen but not often. Lauren will
                  contact your scheduler if she is unable to fill the open
                  shift. She will also contact the staffing coordinator as early
                  as possible if a supplemental staff member has an emergency
                  and needs to cancel.

                  Staffing Strategies is not your typical staffing company. It
                  was initially created to provide supplementary staff solely
                  for our own facilities, but after amassing a large pool of
                  nurses/therapists, we were able to open our available staff to
                  other companies in need.
