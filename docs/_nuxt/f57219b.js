After managing their own supplemental staff at\n        Rehab Strategies, they used that experience and applied it toward\n        opening the next phase of The Strategies enterprise.","Our facilities and partners now benefit from Staffing Strategies’\n        ability to alleviate significant gaps in their therapy coverage.","To help fill these gaps, Staffing Strategies developed a reliable,\n        on-call roster of physical therapists, occupational therapists,\n        speech therapists and specifically trained assistants. Our staff can\n        be assigned to a facility for coverage lasting as short as a few\n        hours to concurrent weeks lasting as long as the facility needs.","In 2018, after such an overwhelming response from facilities needing\n        open shift replacements, Staffing Strategies added nurses to our\n        stable of staffing professionals. We deliver day, evening and\n        overnight shift coverage. Many of the nurses will provide double\n        shift coverage when needed.","Scheduling personnel is a constant strain for all healthcare\n        facilities. Let Staffing Strategies be the one to relieve your\n        stress by utilizing their therapists and available nurses.","At times, all healthcare facilities find themselves short staffed.\n        By utilizing consistent replacement coverage through Staffing\n        Strategies, neither patients nor healthcare providers will\n        experience a lapse in quality care. Staffing Strategies is here for\n        you; let us be the one you call to fill your scheduling void.","Contact Staffing Strategies NOW (317) 383-7979"],heroList:["Pre-Employment Background Screen","Pre-Employment Drug Screen","TB Test","License Verification","Monthly OIG Sanction Checks","CPR Card","Job Description","Hep B Acknowledgement","Flu Acknowledgement","Confidentiality Agreement"],faq:[{question:"How do I know I need Staffing Strategies?",answer:"When your facility has a shift going unfilled and you cannot find coverage through your own full-time and prn staff.\n            "},{question:"What does Staffing Strategies provide?\n            ",answer:"Therapists or nurses to cover open shifts as needed.\n            "},{question:"How do I sign up for Staffing Strategies coverage?\n            ",answer:"Contact Darian Cram at (317) 383-7979 or dcram@staffingstrategies.net and she will provide your company with a contract.
