ITS can provide your therapy department with needed equipment to make treating patients easier.\n            "},{question:"What equipment can ITS provide?",answer:"\n            ITS can order any therapy equipment a department would need, but the MR Cube is their top seller. ITS is the exclusive distributor for the MR Cube.\n            "},{question:"What is the MR Cube?",answer:"\n            It is a portable, functional training and testing device that therapists can use to not only eliminate monotony of a therapy session, but also collect objective data on a patient’s progress.\n            "},{question:"Why should our facility purchase a MR Cube for our therapy gym?",answer:"\n            MR Cube takes the guesswork out of evaluating a patient. With the objective data collected straight to a computer, the patient’s baseline is collected and progress can be obtained with each use.\n            "},{question:"How does the MR Cube work?",answer:"\n            The therapist connects the MR Cube to the patient via a tether and has the patient perform “games” on a computer screen. While the patient is engaged in a fun therapy session, the portable dynamo reads the data collected from the patient and downloads it to a computer.\n            "},{question:"How is the MR Cube better than the old tried and true methods used in the average therapy session?",answer:"\n            The data collected from the MR Cube provides the therapist with objective results instantly while the patient enjoys his/her therapy session. With the exercises creatively disguised as a video game, the patient’s competitive nature is sparked and each therapy session becomes a challenge to increase his/her area of weakness by trying to beat the previous score.\n            "},{question:"\n            How can our therapy department see the MR Cube in action?\n            ",answer:'\n            Contact Jamey Kleva at <a href="mailto: jkleva@innovativetreatment.net">jkleva@innovativetreatment.net</a> and she will schedule a demonstration. Our therapists will set an onsite visit where your therapists and patients can learn about the MR Cube and receive hands on training.\n            '},{question:"How will we know if more than one MR Cube is needed for our department?",answer:"\n            Once your patients experience their exercises on the MR Cube, they will be fighting over MR Cube time.\n            "},{question:"Can the MR Cube be rented to our facility?",answer:'\n            Yes, contact <a href="mailto: jkleva@innovativetreatment.net">Jamey Kleva</a> for details on a rental agreement.\n            '},{question:"Is the software updated and are the updates included in the price?",answer:"\n            Yes, software upgrades are included as they become available for two years. After two years, new updates will be provided for a nominal fee.\n            "},{question:"With staff turnover, how can we avoid a new staff leaving the MR Cube in the corner and not using it to its full potential?",answer:"\n            Our therapists can set up a retraining session to make sure the MR Cube is being used to its full potential.\n            "},{question:"Will the MR Cube pay for itself?",answer:"\n            Yes, by adding additional HCPCS treatment codes, Medicare will reimburse for the MR Cube treatments.\n            "}]}}}]);
